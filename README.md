# Headset Battery Shower

Have a Corsair Headset? Can't see the exact battery level?

Welp this is the solution for you!

# How to use

1. Download and extract the files from the releases tab.
2. Set your username on this PC in the `iCueDir.txt` file
3. Double-click the executable.

Now you see an extract of all log entries which mention "battery" and have a number in it.
The last one will be your headset's latest recorded battery level.

# Building the source code

This project runs on the C++20 standard.
1. Open the project in Visual Studio 2022 (2019 might not work correctly, because the project requires C++20 and MSVC v143)
2. Build and run.

ps: Corsair please fix your iCue software, this is unacceptable.
